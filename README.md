# Installation Guide

### Hardware - What You'll Need

- Raspberry Pi 4b 4GB (Other Raspberry Pi models should also work, I built and tested it on this model)
- Raspberry Camera (RPIZ CAM2 5MP)
- LED-Strip W2812B (if longer than 5m extra power supply could be necessary)
- (LED-Strip for internal light in Box Housing)
- (Speaker for playing the music)

Proper assets to control and power your Raspberry Pi (if you already have assets to control your Raspberry or are controlling it remotly skip this), I used:
- USB-C Cable
- HDMI Cable
- HDMI to Micro HDMI Adapter (GOOBAY 68842)
- Heat Sinks for Raspberry (RPI COOL 4XSI)
- Micro-SD-Karte (LMEX1L064GG2)
- Display with HDMI-Port
- Mouse
- Keyboard

3D-Printer would be optimal to print the housing and the figures.

Printable objects are in the folder "TODO"
